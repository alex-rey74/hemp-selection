* Minor fix in form submission when a user registers and logs in automatically when in checkout.
* Minor fixes in the Javascript of native checkout.
* Fix in installments label in the form element so that it gets through translation and added to pot file.

2020-10-6 - version 1.1.1
* Changes in create transaction API call (a new backend ajax endpoint was created to handle the create transaction call). This fix is addressing an issue for eshops that create user account in checkout page and an error produced by the change of the session when the new user gets logged in.

* Refactoring of the admin_notices function (improved the way messages are shown in admin page).

2020-09-02 - version 1.0.2
* Fixes in hidden form and injected HTML elements. Now these are injected through JavaScript so they are initialised only when the payment method is Viva Wallet native.
* Loader added when the API call is made.
* Fixes in checkout form error handling (Ajax calls added to check WooCommerce form).
* Fixes in the function that creates source (new API call added to check for sources that match the current domain and if the source exists. It saves that one instead of creating a new one).
